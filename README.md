# ENRGY-LOAD-FORECASTING

# ⚡ Short-Term Energy Load Forecasting

This project predicts electricity demand for the next few hours using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.
It includes a live tracking simulation that shows how the model continuously forecasts new energy load values.

# 📌 Features

Time series forecasting of electricity consumption.

LSTM-based deep learning model.

Live tracking of predictions (real-time simulation in Jupyter Notebook).

Visual plots: Actual vs Predicted Load.

Scalable for real-world smart grid data.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
